Project explaination : Citizens who have enrolled into this solution get monetary benefits in terms of schemes. The members get get a monthly score and they can use that score points to get enrolled into government schemes. Members get points for proper waste disposal. This solution goes hand in hand with the  door to door waste collection. The amount of waste a family throws daily is weighed into two different sections BD waste and NBD waste. More points are awarded for BD waste to promote waste segregation(into BD and NBD waste). For NBD waste also points are awarded upto a certain limit.
Also, vehicle score is calculated for each household and points are awarded. The kind of vehicle a person has: petrol, diesel, cng, electric, points are awarded on this criteria.
Apart from this points are also awarded on whether the vehicle is PUC certified or not. The technology on which the engine works: BS4, BS5 or BS6 also contributes to the total score. The vehicle health is also taken into consideration. These things are check every 3 months for each vehicle and total points are awarded.Citizens also get points for the compensation they make to environment like going for clean up drives and planting trees.(More in video)
